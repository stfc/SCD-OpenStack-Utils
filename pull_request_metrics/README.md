# Pull-Request-Metrics

The Pull Request Metrics tool will be used to gather data around the team's pull requests in a selected group of repositories associated with the Cloud Team. This should give us insights to where we can improve our code reviews, which repositories need some extra care and attention, and improve efficiency.
